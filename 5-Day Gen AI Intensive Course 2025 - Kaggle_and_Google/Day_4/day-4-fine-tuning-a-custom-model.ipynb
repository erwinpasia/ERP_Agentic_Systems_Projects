    "# Day 4 - Fine tuning a custom model\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will use the Gemini API to fine-tune a custom, task-specific model. Fine-tuning can be used for a variety of tasks from classic NLP problems like entity extraction or summarisation, to creative tasks like stylised generation. You will fine-tune a model to classify the category a piece of text (a newsgroup post) into the category it belongs to (the newsgroup name).\n",
    "\n",
    "This codelab walks you tuning a model with the API. [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/tune) also supports creating new tuned models directly in the web UI, allowing you to quickly create and monitor models using data from Google Sheets, Drive or your own files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: We recommend doing this codelab first today. There may be a period of waiting while the model tunes, so if you start with this one, you can try the other codelab while you wait."

      "\n",
      "**1988-1989 Pontiac Bonneville Trim Levels**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Base:** The standard Bonneville.  This is the most common model.\n",
      "* **LE:**  \"Luxury Edition\" - added more interior amenities like cloth upholstery, power windows, and door locks.\n",
      "* **SE:** \"Sport Edition\" - included a sport suspension, sport wheels, and a more aggressive appearance.\n",
      "* **LSE:**  Combined features of the LE and SE - so luxury and sport.  \n",
      "* **SSE:** \"Special Sport Edition\" -  Had the most powerful engine offered: a 3.8L V6 with 165 horsepower.  Also included a sport suspension and unique styling.  This model was more performance-oriented.\n",
      "* **SSEi:**  \"Special Sport Edition Injection\" -  A rare model, the SSEi came with a fuel-injected 3.8L V6 that pushed horsepower up to 170. It also included an upgraded interior and special exterior badges.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Book Value**\n",
      "\n",
      "* It's tough to give you a precise book value without knowing the condition, mileage, and specific features of the car. \n",
      "* You can use resources like **Kelley Blue Book (KBB)** or **Edmunds** to get an estimated value. Just input the year, make, model, and trim level.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Negotiating Price**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The **\"book value\"** is a starting point, but you can usually negotiate below it.\n",
      "* **Demand** for older Bonnevilles varies, but generally, they aren't highly sought after. So, you may have room to negotiate.\n",
      "* **Spring and early summer** can be a good time to buy, as car dealers are often trying to move out older inventory.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Condition:** An 88-89 Bonneville in excellent condition will command a higher price.  Look for cars with well-maintained interiors and engines.\n",
      "* **Mileage:** Lower mileage usually translates to a higher price.\n",
      "* **Maintenance records:**  Always ask for service records to assess the car's overall health.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The 88-89 Bonneville can be a good value if you find one in good condition. They are reliable cars but remember they are getting older and may require some maintenance. Do your research, compare prices, and negotiate wisely. \n",
