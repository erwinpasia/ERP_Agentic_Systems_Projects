    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course. In this notebook, you'll learn some techniques for evaluating the output of a language model. As part of the evaluation, you will also use Gemini's structured data capability to produce evaluation results as instances of Python types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This notebook is more code-heavy than the first Day 1 notebook ([Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/)). This notebook is not a prerequisite for days 2 and beyond, so feel free to skip over it, or come back later in the week. If you have not yet tried the [Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/) notebook, start there first as it introduces the fundamentals for interacting with LLMs.\n",

       "Based on the document you provided, here's a breakdown of the training process used for Gemini 1.5 Pro:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Model Architecture:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Gemini 1.5 Pro is a **sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) Transformer-based model.** This means it builds upon the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) but incorporates a MoE structure.\n",
       "*   MoE models use a **learned routing function** to direct inputs to a subset of the model's parameters for processing. This allows the model to have a large total parameter count while only activating a portion of those parameters for any given input.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Training Data:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   The model is trained on a **variety of multimodal and multilingual data.**\n",
       "*   The pre-training dataset includes data sourced from many different domains, including **web documents, code, images, audio, and video content.**\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Training Infrastructure:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Gemini 1.5 Pro is trained on **multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators**, distributed across multiple datacenters.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Training Process:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Pre-training:** The model is initially pre-trained on the large, diverse dataset mentioned above.\n",
       "*   **Instruction Tuning:** After pre-training, Gemini 1.5 Pro is fine-tuned on a collection of multimodal data containing paired instructions and appropriate responses.\n",
       "*   **Human Preference Tuning:** Further tuning is performed based on human preference data.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Aspects and Innovations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Long Context Understanding:** A series of significant architecture changes enable long-context understanding of inputs up to 10 million tokens without degrading performance.\n",
       "*   **Efficiency:** Improvements across the entire model stack (architecture, data, optimization, and systems) allow Gemini 1.5 Pro to achieve comparable quality to Gemini 1.0 Ultra while using significantly less training compute and being significantly more efficient to serve.\n",
       "*   **Multimodality:** The model is natively multimodal and supports interleaving of data from different modalities (audio, visual, text, code) in the same input sequence.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the training process involves a combination of large-scale pre-training on diverse multimodal data, followed by instruction tuning and human preference tuning, all leveraging a MoE architecture and Google's TPU infrastructure. A key focus is on enabling the model to handle extremely long contexts effectively.\n"

       "**Imagine you're teaching a puppy to fetch:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Gathering the Data (The \"Stuff\" to Learn):**\n",
       "    *   Think of all the books, articles, websites, and even videos and audio recordings that the puppy will learn from.\n",
       "    *   For Gemini, this is a massive collection of text, code, images, audio, and video from all over the internet and other sources.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Preparing the Data (Making it Understandable):**\n",
       "    *   You break down the data into smaller pieces that the puppy can digest.\n",
       "    *   For Gemini, this means breaking down the text into individual words or \"tokens,\" and converting images, audio, and video into numerical representations that the computer can understand.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Building the Brain (The Model):**\n",
       "    *   You give the puppy a brain that can learn patterns and relationships in the data.\n",
       "    *   For Gemini, this is a large neural network, a complex mathematical structure with millions or even billions of parameters (think of them as knobs and dials that can be adjusted).\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Training (The Learning Process):**\n",
       "    *   You show the puppy examples of what you want it to learn. For example, you might show it a ball and say \"fetch.\"\n",
       "    *   For Gemini, this means feeding the model the prepared data and asking it to predict the next word or token in a sequence.\n",
       "    *   The model makes a guess, and then you tell it whether it was right or wrong.\n",
       "    *   If the model was wrong, you adjust the parameters in its brain to make it more likely to get it right next time.\n",
       "    *   This process is repeated millions or billions of times, until the model becomes very good at predicting the next word or token.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Fine-tuning (Polishing the Skills):**\n",
       "    *   You give the puppy specific instructions on how to behave. For example, you might tell it to \"sit\" or \"stay.\"\n",
       "    *   For Gemini, this means training the model on a smaller dataset of specific tasks, such as answering questions, summarizing text, or translating languages.\n",
       "    *   This helps the model to learn how to use its knowledge to perform specific tasks.\n",
       "\n",
       "6.  **Evaluation (Testing the Skills):**\n",
       "    *   You test the puppy to see how well it has learned. For example, you might throw a ball and see if it fetches it.\n",
       "    *   For Gemini, this means giving the model a set of questions or tasks that it has never seen before and measuring how well it performs.\n",
       "    *   This helps you to identify any weaknesses in the model and to improve its performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Concepts:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Multimodal:** Gemini can understand and process different types of data, like text, images, audio, and video.\n",
       "*   **Tokens:** The basic units of text that the model processes (usually words or parts of words).\n",
       "*   **Neural Network:** A complex mathematical structure that can learn patterns and relationships in data.\n",
       "*   **Parameters:** The knobs and dials in the neural network that are adjusted during training.\n",
       "*   **Training Data:** The massive collection of data that the model learns from.\n",
       "*   **Fine-tuning:** Training the model on a smaller dataset of specific tasks.\n",
       "*   **Evaluation:** Testing the model to see how well it has learned.\n",
       "\n",

    "\n",
    "### LLM limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.\n",
