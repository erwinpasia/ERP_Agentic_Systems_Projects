    "Imagine you are working in a customer support center that receives a high volume of inquiries and tickets every day. Your task is to create a system that can quickly provide support agents with the most relevant information to resolve customer issues. Traditional methods of searching through FAQs or support documents can be slow and inefficient, leading to delayed responses and dissatisfied customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, you will use embedding models to convert support documents and past inquiry responses into numerical vectors that capture their semantic content. These vectors will be stored in a vector database, enabling fast and accurate similarity searches. For example, when a support agent receives a new inquiry about a product issue, the system can instantly retrieve similar past inquiries and their resolutions, helping the agent to provide a quicker and more accurate response.\n"
