# L6: Multi-agent Collaboration for Financial Analysis

In this lesson, you will learn ways for making agents collaborate with each other.

The libraries are already installed in the classroom. If you're running this notebook on your own machine, you can install the following:
```Python
!pip install crewai==0.28.8 crewai_tools==0.1.6 langchain_community==0.0.29
```


```python
# Warning control
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

- Import libraries, APIs and LLM


```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
```

**Note**: 
- The video uses `gpt-4-turbo`, but due to certain constraints, and in order to offer this course for free to everyone, the code you'll run here will use `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
- You can use `gpt-4-turbo` when you run the notebook _locally_ (using `gpt-4-turbo` will not work on the platform)
- Thank you for your understanding!


```python
import os
from utils import get_openai_api_key, get_serper_api_key

openai_api_key = get_openai_api_key()
os.environ["OPENAI_MODEL_NAME"] = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = get_serper_api_key()
```

## crewAI Tools


```python
from crewai_tools import ScrapeWebsiteTool, SerperDevTool

search_tool = SerperDevTool()
scrape_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool()
```

## Creating Agents


```python
data_analyst_agent = Agent(
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Monitor and analyze market data in real-time "
         "to identify trends and predict market movements.",
    backstory="Specializing in financial markets, this agent "
              "uses statistical modeling and machine learning "
              "to provide crucial insights. With a knack for data, "
              "the Data Analyst Agent is the cornerstone for "
              "informing trading decisions.",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=True,
    tools = [scrape_tool, search_tool]
)
```


```python
trading_strategy_agent = Agent(
    role="Trading Strategy Developer",
    goal="Develop and test various trading strategies based "
         "on insights from the Data Analyst Agent.",
    backstory="Equipped with a deep understanding of financial "
              "markets and quantitative analysis, this agent "
              "devises and refines trading strategies. It evaluates "
              "the performance of different approaches to determine "
              "the most profitable and risk-averse options.",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=True,
    tools = [scrape_tool, search_tool]
)
```


```python
execution_agent = Agent(
    role="Trade Advisor",
    goal="Suggest optimal trade execution strategies "
         "based on approved trading strategies.",
    backstory="This agent specializes in analyzing the timing, price, "
              "and logistical details of potential trades. By evaluating "
              "these factors, it provides well-founded suggestions for "
              "when and how trades should be executed to maximize "
              "efficiency and adherence to strategy.",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=True,
    tools = [scrape_tool, search_tool]
)
```


```python
risk_management_agent = Agent(
    role="Risk Advisor",
    goal="Evaluate and provide insights on the risks "
         "associated with potential trading activities.",
    backstory="Armed with a deep understanding of risk assessment models "
              "and market dynamics, this agent scrutinizes the potential "
              "risks of proposed trades. It offers a detailed analysis of "
              "risk exposure and suggests safeguards to ensure that "
              "trading activities align with the firm’s risk tolerance.",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=True,
    tools = [scrape_tool, search_tool]
)
```

## Creating Tasks


```python
# Task for Data Analyst Agent: Analyze Market Data
data_analysis_task = Task(
    description=(
        "Continuously monitor and analyze market data for "
        "the selected stock ({stock_selection}). "
        "Use statistical modeling and machine learning to "
        "identify trends and predict market movements."
    ),
    expected_output=(
        "Insights and alerts about significant market "
        "opportunities or threats for {stock_selection}."
    ),
    agent=data_analyst_agent,
)
```


```python
# Task for Trading Strategy Agent: Develop Trading Strategies
strategy_development_task = Task(
    description=(
        "Develop and refine trading strategies based on "
        "the insights from the Data Analyst and "
        "user-defined risk tolerance ({risk_tolerance}). "
        "Consider trading preferences ({trading_strategy_preference})."
    ),
    expected_output=(
        "A set of potential trading strategies for {stock_selection} "
        "that align with the user's risk tolerance."
    ),
    agent=trading_strategy_agent,
)

```


```python
# Task for Trade Advisor Agent: Plan Trade Execution
execution_planning_task = Task(
    description=(
        "Analyze approved trading strategies to determine the "
        "best execution methods for {stock_selection}, "
        "considering current market conditions and optimal pricing."
    ),
    expected_output=(
        "Detailed execution plans suggesting how and when to "
        "execute trades for {stock_selection}."
    ),
    agent=execution_agent,
)

```


```python
# Task for Risk Advisor Agent: Assess Trading Risks
risk_assessment_task = Task(
    description=(
        "Evaluate the risks associated with the proposed trading "
        "strategies and execution plans for {stock_selection}. "
        "Provide a detailed analysis of potential risks "
        "and suggest mitigation strategies."
    ),
    expected_output=(
        "A comprehensive risk analysis report detailing potential "
        "risks and mitigation recommendations for {stock_selection}."
    ),
    agent=risk_management_agent,
)
```

## Creating the Crew
- The `Process` class helps to delegate the workflow to the Agents (kind of like a Manager at work)
- In the example below, it will run this hierarchically.
- `manager_llm` lets you choose the "manager" LLM you want to use.


```python
from crewai import Crew, Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Define the crew with agents and tasks
financial_trading_crew = Crew(
    agents=[data_analyst_agent, 
            trading_strategy_agent, 
            execution_agent, 
            risk_management_agent],
    
    tasks=[data_analysis_task, 
           strategy_development_task, 
           execution_planning_task, 
           risk_assessment_task],
    
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", 
                           temperature=0.7),
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    verbose=True
)
```

## Running the Crew

- Set the inputs for the execution of the crew.


```python
# Example data for kicking off the process
financial_trading_inputs = {
    'stock_selection': 'AAPL',
    'initial_capital': '100000',
    'risk_tolerance': 'Medium',
    'trading_strategy_preference': 'Day Trading',
    'news_impact_consideration': True
}
```

**Note**: LLMs can provide different outputs for they same input, so what you get might be different than what you see in the video.


```python
### this execution will take some time to run
result = financial_trading_crew.kickoff(inputs=financial_trading_inputs)
```

    Based on the insights provided by the Data Analyst on market data for AAPL and the user's specified medium risk tolerance level for trading AAPL, the potential trading strategies for AAPL that align with the user's risk tolerance are as follows:
    
    1. Long-term investment in AAPL stock: Considering Apple Inc.'s strong financial metrics and positive total returns, a long-term investment strategy could be suitable for the user's medium risk tolerance level.
    
    2. Covered call options strategy: Utilizing options trading with covered calls on AAPL stock could provide a balance of risk and potential returns for the user within their defined risk tolerance.
    
    3. Dollar-cost averaging approach: Implementing a dollar-cost averaging strategy for regular purchases of AAPL stock over time could help mitigate risk and align with the user's medium risk tolerance.
    
    4. Diversified portfolio with AAPL exposure: Building a diversified investment portfolio with exposure to AAPL stock along with other assets could provide risk diversification while still capitalizing on potential opportunities in the market.
    
    These trading strategies for AAPL take into account the insights from the Data Analyst and are tailored to the user's risk tolerance level, aiming to achieve the best possible outcome for the user's trading preferences.[0m

    I was unable to access the specific information on the risks associated with AAPL and the proposed trading strategies on the Investopedia website. However, based on my expertise, I can provide a comprehensive risk analysis of the proposed trading strategies for AAPL and suggest mitigation strategies.
    
    1. Long-term investment in AAPL stock:
    - Risk: Market volatility and fluctuations in the tech industry can impact the stock price.
    - Mitigation: Diversification of the portfolio to reduce exposure to AAPL, setting stop-loss orders, and staying informed about market trends.
    
    2. Covered call options strategy:
    - Risk: Limited upside potential if the stock price surpasses the call option strike price.
    - Mitigation: Implementing proper risk management techniques, understanding the options market, and using strategies like protective puts.
    
    3. Dollar-cost averaging approach:
    - Risk: Market timing risk and potential losses if the stock price declines consistently.
    - Mitigation: Setting a consistent investment schedule, diversifying the investment across different time periods, and staying focused on long-term goals.
    
    4. Diversified portfolio with AAPL exposure:
    - Risk: Concentration risk if AAPL underperforms compared to other assets in the portfolio.
    - Mitigation: Regular portfolio rebalancing, diversifying across various asset classes, and monitoring the performance of AAPL relative to other investments.
    
    Overall, it's important to consider the individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon when executing these trading strategies for AAPL. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and adjust the strategies accordingly to manage risks effectively.[0m
