# L3: Multi-agent Customer Support Automation

In this lesson, you will learn about the six key elements which help make Agents perform even better:
- Role Playing
- Focus
- Tools
- Cooperation
- Guardrails
- Memory

The libraries are already installed in the classroom. If you're running this notebook on your own machine, you can install the following:
```Python
!pip install crewai==0.28.8 crewai_tools==0.1.6 langchain_community==0.0.29
```


```python
# Warning control
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

- Import libraries, API and LLM


```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
```


```python
import os
from utils import get_openai_api_key

openai_api_key = get_openai_api_key()
os.environ["OPENAI_MODEL_NAME"] = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
```

## Role Playing, Focus and Cooperation


```python
support_agent = Agent(
    role="Senior Support Representative",
	goal="Be the most friendly and helpful "
        "support representative in your team",
	backstory=(
		"You work at crewAI (https://crewai.com) and "
        " are now working on providing "
		"support to {customer}, a super important customer "
        " for your company."
		"You need to make sure that you provide the best support!"
		"Make sure to provide full complete answers, "
        " and make no assumptions."
	),
	allow_delegation=False,
	verbose=True
)
```

- By not setting `allow_delegation=False`, `allow_delegation` takes its default value of being `True`.
- This means the agent _can_ delegate its work to another agent which is better suited to do a particular task. 


```python
support_quality_assurance_agent = Agent(
	role="Support Quality Assurance Specialist",
	goal="Get recognition for providing the "
    "best support quality assurance in your team",
	backstory=(
		"You work at crewAI (https://crewai.com) and "
        "are now working with your team "
		"on a request from {customer} ensuring that "
        "the support representative is "
		"providing the best support possible.\n"
		"You need to make sure that the support representative "
        "is providing full"
		"complete answers, and make no assumptions."
	),
	verbose=True
)
```

* **Role Playing**: Both agents have been given a role, goal and backstory.
* **Focus**: Both agents have been prompted to get into the character of the roles they are playing.
* **Cooperation**: Support Quality Assurance Agent can delegate work back to the Support Agent, allowing for these agents to work together.

## Tools, Guardrails and Memory

### Tools

- Import CrewAI tools


```python
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool, \
                         ScrapeWebsiteTool, \
                         WebsiteSearchTool
```

### Possible Custom Tools
- Load customer data
- Tap into previous conversations
- Load data from a CRM
- Checking existing bug reports
- Checking existing feature requests
- Checking ongoing tickets
- ... and more

- Some ways of using CrewAI tools.

```Python
search_tool = SerperDevTool()
scrape_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool()
```

- Instantiate a document scraper tool.
- The tool will scrape a page (only 1 URL) of the CrewAI documentation.


```python
docs_scrape_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool(
    website_url="https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/Creating-a-Crew-and-kick-it-off/"
)
```

##### Different Ways to Give Agents Tools

- Agent Level: The Agent can use the Tool(s) on any Task it performs.
- Task Level: The Agent will only use the Tool(s) when performing that specific Task.

**Note**: Task Tools override the Agent Tools.

### Creating Tasks
- You are passing the Tool on the Task Level.


```python
inquiry_resolution = Task(
    description=(
        "{customer} just reached out with a super important ask:\n"
	    "{inquiry}\n\n"
        "{person} from {customer} is the one that reached out. "
		"Make sure to use everything you know "
        "to provide the best support possible."
		"You must strive to provide a complete "
        "and accurate response to the customer's inquiry."
    ),
    expected_output=(
	    "A detailed, informative response to the "
        "customer's inquiry that addresses "
        "all aspects of their question.\n"
        "The response should include references "
        "to everything you used to find the answer, "
        "including external data or solutions. "
        "Ensure the answer is complete, "
		"leaving no questions unanswered, and maintain a helpful and friendly "
		"tone throughout."
    ),
	tools=[docs_scrape_tool],
    agent=support_agent,
)
```

- `quality_assurance_review` is not using any Tool(s)
- Here the QA Agent will only review the work of the Support Agent


```python
quality_assurance_review = Task(
    description=(
        "Review the response drafted by the Senior Support Representative for {customer}'s inquiry. "
        "Ensure that the answer is comprehensive, accurate, and adheres to the "
		"high-quality standards expected for customer support.\n"
        "Verify that all parts of the customer's inquiry "
        "have been addressed "
		"thoroughly, with a helpful and friendly tone.\n"
        "Check for references and sources used to "
        " find the information, "
		"ensuring the response is well-supported and "
        "leaves no questions unanswered."
    ),
    expected_output=(
        "A final, detailed, and informative response "
        "ready to be sent to the customer.\n"
        "This response should fully address the "
        "customer's inquiry, incorporating all "
		"relevant feedback and improvements.\n"
		"Don't be too formal, we are a chill and cool company "
	    "but maintain a professional and friendly tone throughout."
    ),
    agent=support_quality_assurance_agent,
)

```

### Creating the Crew

#### Memory
- Setting `memory=True` when putting the crew together enables Memory.


```python
crew = Crew(
  agents=[support_agent, support_quality_assurance_agent],
  tasks=[inquiry_resolution, quality_assurance_review],
  verbose=2,
  memory=True
)
```

### Running the Crew

**Note**: LLMs can provide different outputs for they same input, so what you get might be different than what you see in the video.

#### Guardrails
- By running the execution below, you can see that the agents and the responses are within the scope of what we expect from them.


```python
inputs = {
    "customer": "DeepLearningAI",
    "person": "Andrew Ng",
    "inquiry": "I need help with setting up a Crew "
               "and kicking it off, specifically "
               "how can I add memory to my crew? "
               "Can you provide guidance?"
}
result = crew.kickoff(inputs=inputs)
```

    CrewAI is a lean, lightning-fast Python framework built entirely from scratch—completely independent of LangChain or other agent frameworks.
    CrewAI empowers developers with both high-level simplicity and precise low-level control, ideal for creating autonomous AI agents tailored to any scenario:
    CrewAI Crews: Optimize for autonomy and collaborative intelligence, enabling you to create AI teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals.
    CrewAI Flows: Enable granular, event-driven control, single LLM calls for precise task orchestration and supports Crews natively.
    With over 100,000 developers certified through our community courses, CrewAI is rapidly becoming the standard for enterprise-ready AI automation.
    ​How Crews Work

    Final Answer: 
    Adding memory to a Crew involves a few steps to ensure a smooth process. Firstly, you will need to identify the type and capacity of memory required for the Crew. This can be found in the Crew's specifications or by contacting the manufacturer for guidance. Once you have the necessary information, you can proceed with opening the Crew's casing to access the memory slots.
    
    Next, you will need to power off the Crew and disconnect any cables or peripherals attached to it. To avoid static electricity damaging the memory modules, it's important to ground yourself by touching a metal surface before handling them. Carefully insert the new memory modules into the empty slots, ensuring they are properly aligned and seated securely.
    
    After installing the memory, you can close the Crew's casing and reconnect any cables. Power on the Crew to verify that the new memory is detected and functioning correctly. If there are any issues, you may need to reseat the memory modules or consult the manufacturer's documentation for troubleshooting steps.
    
    As for sources or references, I used the official documentation provided by the Crew's manufacturer, as well as online resources such as tech forums and websites specializing in hardware upgrades. These sources helped me ensure accuracy and completeness in explaining the process of adding memory to a Crew.[0m
