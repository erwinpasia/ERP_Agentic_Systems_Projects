# L5: Automate Event Planning

In this lesson, you will learn more about Tasks.

The libraries are already installed in the classroom. If you're running this notebook on your own machine, you can install the following:
```Python
!pip install crewai==0.28.8 crewai_tools==0.1.6 langchain_community==0.0.29
```


```python
# Warning control
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

- Import libraries, APIs and LLM


```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task
```

**Note**: 
- The video uses `gpt-4-turbo`, but due to certain constraints, and in order to offer this course for free to everyone, the code you'll run here will use `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
- You can use `gpt-4-turbo` when you run the notebook _locally_ (using `gpt-4-turbo` will not work on the platform)
- Thank you for your understanding!


```python
import os
from utils import get_openai_api_key,get_serper_api_key

openai_api_key = get_openai_api_key()
os.environ["OPENAI_MODEL_NAME"] = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = get_serper_api_key()
```

## crewAI Tools


```python
from crewai_tools import ScrapeWebsiteTool, SerperDevTool

# Initialize the tools
search_tool = SerperDevTool()
scrape_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool()
```

## Creating Agents


```python
# Agent 1: Venue Coordinator
venue_coordinator = Agent(
    role="Venue Coordinator",
    goal="Identify and book an appropriate venue "
    "based on event requirements",
    tools=[search_tool, scrape_tool],
    verbose=True,
    backstory=(
        "With a keen sense of space and "
        "understanding of event logistics, "
        "you excel at finding and securing "
        "the perfect venue that fits the event's theme, "
        "size, and budget constraints."
    )
)
```


```python
 # Agent 2: Logistics Manager
logistics_manager = Agent(
    role='Logistics Manager',
    goal=(
        "Manage all logistics for the event "
        "including catering and equipmen"
    ),
    tools=[search_tool, scrape_tool],
    verbose=True,
    backstory=(
        "Organized and detail-oriented, "
        "you ensure that every logistical aspect of the event "
        "from catering to equipment setup "
        "is flawlessly executed to create a seamless experience."
    )
)
```


```python
# Agent 3: Marketing and Communications Agent
marketing_communications_agent = Agent(
    role="Marketing and Communications Agent",
    goal="Effectively market the event and "
         "communicate with participants",
    tools=[search_tool, scrape_tool],
    verbose=True,
    backstory=(
        "Creative and communicative, "
        "you craft compelling messages and "
        "engage with potential attendees "
        "to maximize event exposure and participation."
    )
)
```

## Creating Venue Pydantic Object

- Create a class `VenueDetails` using [Pydantic BaseModel](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/).
- Agents will populate this object with information about different venues by creating different instances of it.


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
# Define a Pydantic model for venue details 
# (demonstrating Output as Pydantic)
class VenueDetails(BaseModel):
    name: str
    address: str
    capacity: int
    booking_status: str
```

## Creating Tasks
- By using `output_json`, you can specify the structure of the output you want.
- By using `output_file`, you can get your output in a file.
- By setting `human_input=True`, the task will ask for human feedback (whether you like the results or not) before finalising it.


```python
venue_task = Task(
    description="Find a venue in {event_city} "
                "that meets criteria for {event_topic}.",
    expected_output="All the details of a specifically chosen"
                    "venue you found to accommodate the event.",
    human_input=True,
    output_json=VenueDetails,
    output_file="venue_details.json",  
      # Outputs the venue details as a JSON file
    agent=venue_coordinator
)
```

- By setting `async_execution=True`, it means the task can run in parallel with the tasks which come after it.


```python
logistics_task = Task(
    description="Coordinate catering and "
                 "equipment for an event "
                 "with {expected_participants} participants "
                 "on {tentative_date}.",
    expected_output="Confirmation of all logistics arrangements "
                    "including catering and equipment setup.",
    human_input=True,
    async_execution=True,
    agent=logistics_manager
)
```


```python
marketing_task = Task(
    description="Promote the {event_topic} "
                "aiming to engage at least"
                "{expected_participants} potential attendees.",
    expected_output="Report on marketing activities "
                    "and attendee engagement formatted as markdown.",
    async_execution=True,
    output_file="marketing_report.md",  # Outputs the report as a text file
    agent=marketing_communications_agent
)
```

## Creating the Crew

**Note**: Since you set `async_execution=True` for `logistics_task` and `marketing_task` tasks, now the order for them does not matter in the `tasks` list.


```python
# Define the crew with agents and tasks
event_management_crew = Crew(
    agents=[venue_coordinator, 
            logistics_manager, 
            marketing_communications_agent],
    
    tasks=[venue_task, 
           logistics_task, 
           marketing_task],
    
    verbose=True
)
```

## Running the Crew

- Set the inputs for the execution of the crew.


```python
event_details = {
    'event_topic': "Tech Innovation Conference",
    'event_description': "A gathering of tech innovators "
                         "and industry leaders "
                         "to explore future technologies.",
    'event_city': "San Francisco",
    'tentative_date': "2024-09-15",
    'expected_participants': 500,
    'budget': 20000,
    'venue_type': "Conference Hall"
}
```

**Note 1**: LLMs can provide different outputs for they same input, so what you get might be different than what you see in the video.

**Note 2**: 
- Since you set `human_input=True` for some tasks, the execution will ask for your input before it finishes running.
- When it asks for feedback, use your mouse pointer to first click in the text box before typing anything.


```python
result = event_management_crew.kickoff(inputs=event_details)
```

The Main Dining Room accommodates 220 seated, or 300 standing people, while the Cafe space accommodates 250 seated or 300 standing.¬†What The City Club of San Francisco Venue is Great ForOne of the top criteria for the perfect venue is that there‚Äôs enough space to comfortably accommodate event attendees, as well as guest speakers, tech setup, etc. The City Club of San Francisco fits the bill, with multiple event spaces for business meetings and corporate events of all sizes.10. The Box SFNeed something a little different for your upcoming business meeting events? Consider The Box SF, a historic four-story building on Howard Street.¬†This one-stop shop for historic 1850s-style memorabilia also offers multiple event spaces for business meetings and workshops. The venue has many gems in store for your business clients, including the country‚Äôs oldest and longest meeting and dining table.Small groups of eight can be accommodated in the Speakeasy style Sipping Room, while the Willy Suite has room for 10, and the Webster Suite has space for 14 people. For meetings of up to 30 people, choose the Buddy Suite, or the Gate Room & Top Floor space for 50 seated or 80 standing people.Projectors, projection screens, flat screen monitors, and other equipment are available at a fee for business presentations. A bar and catering options are available.¬†What The Box SF is Great ForThe Box is the ideal venue for clients involved in publishing and media. They‚Äôll love The Pressroom and Mercantile space on the ground floor. The working press room boasts original restored printing presses dating back to 1838. The historic printing shop and 1850s mercantile can be rented for video shoots, too.¬†Tips for Planning a Conference or Meeting in San FranciscoPlanning a conference or meeting in San Fran goes beyond choosing the best venue. Here are our top tips:Celebrate San Fran‚Äôs History and Diversity¬†San Francisco is a culturally diverse city with a legacy of artistic expression and Bohemian culture alongside some of the greatest tech innovations. So, if you‚Äôre looking for guest speakers at a conference, invite people from the local tech sector and/or local artists to participate.¬†If you‚Äôre using a venue that offers meals or catering, choose one that exemplifies San Fran‚Äôs rich cultural diversity in their cuisine. This is an opportunity to introduce attendees to other cultures and celebrate diversity within their organization.¬†¬†Be Open to Multi-Purpose Venues¬†There are many venues that, while not intended solely for corporate use, have meeting rooms or conferencing setups. In between the meetings or when the conference is over, attendees can then move to the other spaces for food and drinks.With clever planning, many venues ordinarily used for private events can be used for meetings, conferences, and other corporate events. Restaurants and social clubs already have the space and tables and chairs you‚Äôll need for meetings. Lounge areas can be used for informal networking.You‚Äôll find the perfect venue for every occasion on the Perfect Venue Marketplace.¬†Consider the Needs of Attendees From Out of TownAre you planning a large conference for a company with nationwide branches? Attendees who don‚Äôt live nearby will have to travel and be accommodated locally while attending the San Fran meetings. In such cases, a hotel venue with corporate event facilities may be best.Organizing car hire is common with large conferences. But navigating San Francisco‚Äôs hilly terrain and steep streets can be very challenging for non-locals. Make their lives easier with a guide to Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) trains, buses and streetcars (Muni Metro), and ferries.¬†Find the Perfect San Fran Venue on Perfect Venue MarketplaceThe City by the Bay has countless restaurants, hotels, and other venues for all types of events, from large corporate conferences to small business meetings. With so much choice, it can be difficult to find the right venue quickly while planning such events.¬†But not when you use Perfect Venue Marketplace. We make it easy to choose the best conference and meeting venues every time. Just enter your search criteria ‚Äî location, number of attendees, and type of event, and choose from our wide selection of unique and top-rated venues.¬†Your search for the perfect venue starts, and ends, here.Have thoughts on the article?¬†Feel free to email us at hello@perfectvenue.com - we'd love to hear it!SkylerAccount ExecutiveI have been in hospitality for over a decade, most recently as the Events Sales Manager at a 3-star Michelin restaurant in San Francisco.

    12 Proven Conference Marketing Ideas to Elevate Your Event
    Looking for innovative ways to attract the right audience to your conference? This guide shares 12 proven marketing strategies to boost attendance, increase engagement, and ensure your event stands out.
    Identify Your Target Audience
    Understanding your potential attendees is crucial for successful conference marketing.
    Tailor Marketing Messages
    Conduct thorough research to identify the various segments within your target audience and develop attendee personas based on factors like profession, interests, and level of expertise. Craft marketing messages that address the specific needs and interests of each group.¬†
    Personalized content is more likely to capture attention and encourage action. Segment your email campaigns to deliver these tailored messages effectively, increasing the relevance of your communications and improving response rates. With Swoogo, you can segment, build, and execute automated email flows that are personalized for every attendee. Our advanced visibility logic delivers a tailored experience for every attendee.
    Utilize Demographic Data
    Collect information such as age, job role, location, and industry to better understand what your potential attendees care about.¬†
    Use this data to personalize your outreach efforts further. Analyzing demographic data also helps you choose the most effective marketing channels.
    By using audience data, you can focus on your target audience and tailor your marketing strategies accordingly, increasing the likelihood of attracting the right attendees to your conference.
    Build a Brand for Your Event
    Creating a memorable brand for your conference is essential to attract the right audience and stand out in a crowded market.
    Use Consistent Branding
    Consistency in branding builds recognition and trust. Ensure that all promotional materials‚Äîfrom your registration page, to your emails, to your post-event follow-up‚Äîshare the same visual elements and messaging. With Swoogo, you can make sure that every touchpoint of your event, from start to finish, puts your brand front and center. 
    Develop a style guide: Create guidelines that specify your event's logos, color palette, fonts, and tone of voice.
    Apply branding uniformly: Use the same logos, colors, and design elements across your website, social media profiles, email campaigns, and print materials.
    Design branded templates: Create templates for emails, social media posts, and presentations to ensure consistent communication.
    By presenting a cohesive brand image, you make it easier for potential attendees to recognize and remember your event.
    Develop a Unique Value Proposition
    To draw in attendees, your event needs to offer something distinctive. Define what makes your conference special and communicate that clearly.
    Identify what sets your event apart: Consider aspects like exclusive speakers, creative session formats, or unique networking opportunities.
    Craft a compelling message: Articulate your event's value proposition in a clear and engaging way.
    Highlight your unique offerings: Ensure your value proposition is prominent on your event website and promotional materials.
    By clearly communicating your event's unique value, you give potential attendees a compelling reason to choose your conference over others.
    Diversify Your Marketing Content
    Offering a mix of content formats can help you reach a wider audience and keep them engaged.
    Use Blogs, Videos, Infographics
    Different people consume content in different ways. By creating a variety of content types, you can cater to these preferences and increase engagement.
    Start a conference blog that shares industry insights, event updates, and speaker interviews.
    Produce promotional videos highlighting past conferences or offering sneak peeks into upcoming sessions.
    Develop infographics that present key industry statistics or trends.
    Host webinars featuring key speakers before the event.
    Create a podcast series featuring interviews with speakers or discussions on conference themes.
    By diversifying your content, including exploring strategies for marketing hybrid events, you provide multiple entry points for potential attendees to learn about your conference.
    Create Shareable Content
    Designing content that is easy to share can significantly extend your event's reach.
    Produce engaging social media content such as teaser videos, speaker quotes, or behind-the-scenes glimpses.
    Design shareable graphics for attendees to post on their own social media profiles.
    Provide pre-written social media posts and graphics to speakers and partners.
    Offer shareable resources like whitepapers or guides related to your conference topics.
    Use interactive content like polls or quizzes related to your conference themes.
    Encourage user-generated content by inviting attendees to share their excitement using a specific event hashtag.
    Implementing innovative tactics such as guerrilla marketing strategies, can capture attention and encourage sharing.
    Create a Conference Website
    A dedicated event website is essential for providing attendees with all the information they need and for promoting your conference effectively. A registration page built on Swoogo puts your brand first; allows you to build unlimited registration types, custom questions, or conditional logic; and connects your event data seamlessly with the rest of your tech stack. 
    Use High-Quality Images and Clear Information
    Incorporate high-quality images that capture the essence of your conference and resonate with your audience. Clearly lay out the agenda, including session times, topics, and speaker bios. Include essential information such as venue details, registration options, and FAQs.¬†
    An organized and visually appealing website encourages visitors to register and share the event with others.
    Optimize the Site for Mobile and Search Engines
    Ensure your website is mobile-friendly, with responsive pages that load correctly on various devices. Optimizing your website for search engines increases its visibility. Use relevant keywords, include meta descriptions, and ensure that your site's structure is accessible to search engine crawlers.¬†
    Implement SEO best practices like optimizing page titles, using header tags effectively, and creating quality content that appeals to your target audience.
    Using the right tools, such as event management software like Swoogo, can greatly enhance your event planning process.
    Implement Event Gamification
    Engaging your attendees is crucial, and incorporating gamification elements can transform your event into an interactive experience.
    Use Leaderboards, Quizzes, and Virtual Scavenger Hunts
    Introduce game-like features to boost participation. Implement virtual scavenger hunts that prompt participants to explore different event offerings, visit specific booths, and engage with sponsors.¬†
    Display leaderboards to showcase the top engaged attendees, fostering a friendly competitive atmosphere. Consider using badge collection challenges where attendees earn badges for completing specific tasks or attending certain sessions.
    Incorporating event gamification strategies can make your event more engaging and enjoyable.
    Encourage Participation Through Rewards and Prizes
    Motivate attendees to engage by offering rewards and prizes. Award digital badges or points for completing tasks, achieving milestones, and participating in interactive sessions. Providing tangible incentives like gift cards, exclusive merchandise, or discounts on future events can further encourage active participation.¬†
    Consider integrating augmented reality (AR) experiences using QR codes on conference materials to unlock surprises or special content. Gamification not only makes the event more enjoyable, but can also enhance learning and networking opportunities.
    Survey Your Audience Post-Event
    Gathering feedback from your attendees after the conference is essential for continuous improvement.
    Use Data From Surveys
    Design a concise online survey to collect attendees' thoughts on various aspects of the conference. Focus on key areas such as session content, speaker performance, and overall satisfaction.¬†
    To encourage higher response rates, consider offering incentives like access to exclusive presentation materials or a discount on registration for your next event.
    Once you've collected the responses, analyze the data to identify trends and insights. Tracking event KPIs can help you measure success and areas for improvement.
    Analyze Feedback
    Delve into the survey results to uncover your attendees' preferences and any challenges they faced. Addressing these issues shows your audience that you value their opinions and are committed to enhancing their experience.¬†
    Communicate any planned changes based on the feedback you've received. Using feedback not only helps you refine your event but also provides valuable insights into your audience's evolving needs and interests, helping you drive customer retention.
    Partner With Industry Professionals
    Collaborating with industry professionals can significantly amplify your conference's reach and credibility.
    Engage Influencers and Industry Experts
    Identify key influencers and thought leaders in your industry and involve them in your conference. Consider inviting them to speak at or host sessions, endorse your event on their platforms, and collaborate on promotional content.¬†
    Engaging influencers not only broadens your audience but also adds value to your conference program. Provide clear information about the event's goals and benefits, and offer incentives like complimentary tickets or special recognition.
    Utilize Partnerships
    Partnering with related organizations, sponsors, and industry associations can expand your promotional efforts and lend credibility to your event. Explore opportunities to cross-promote at complementary events or through partner channels, exchange email promotions with organizations, and collaborate on content marketing efforts.¬†
    By collaborating with these partners, you can tap into their established networks and enhance the visibility of your event.
    Provide an Interactive Experience
    Creating interactive experiences at your conference can significantly increase attendee engagement and satisfaction.
    Host Pre-Conference Workshops and Interactive Sessions
    Hosting pre-conference workshops and interactive sessions allows attendees to dive deeper into topics of interest before the main event. These sessions offer hands-on learning opportunities and create an additional touchpoint with your audience.¬†
    Consider offering workshops that align with the interests and needs of your target audience. These are great ways of creating event experiences that resonate with attendees.
    Incorporate Q&A Sessions and Panels
    Integrating Q&A sessions and panel discussions into your conference schedule provides opportunities for direct engagement with speakers and industry experts.¬†
    Using interactive tools, such as live polling or moderated Q&A platforms, can enhance audience participation. Implementing technology solutions, such as event apps or interactive platforms, can further enhance engagement during Q&A sessions and panels.
    Use Social Media to Promote
    Social media is a powerful tool to amplify your conference's reach and connect with potential attendees.
    Create Engaging Content, Run Polls, and Use Live Streaming
    Share diverse and interactive content across your social media platforms to generate interest in your event. Implement social media hacks for events, such as posting behind-the-scenes content, highlighting speakers and sessions, running polls and surveys, using live streaming, and sharing attendee testimonials.¬†
    Consistently posting engaging content keeps your event visible and encourages shares, expanding your reach organically.
    Use Event Hashtags
    Creating a unique and memorable event hashtag is essential for consolidating all conversations related to your conference. Promote the hashtag early, encourage its usage, monitor and engage with posts, showcase user-generated content, and analyze hashtag performance after the event.¬†
    By unifying conversations under a single hashtag, you make it easier for everyone involved to connect and stay informed.
    Offer Early Bird Discounts
    Offering early bird discounts is an effective way to encourage attendees to register ahead of time.
    Create Urgency and Incentivize Early Registrations
    Introducing tiered pricing that increases as the event date approaches can prompt attendees to act quickly. Consider providing group rates or rewards for referrals to further incentivize early sign-ups.
    Promote Limited-Time Offers
    Targeted email campaigns are a powerful tool to inform your audience about early bird discounts. Send personalized emails with clear calls to action, as well as reminders about approaching deadlines for early bird pricing. With Swoogo, you can personalize your email flows to keep registrants engaged all the way to, and past, your event. 
    Use Webinars for Promotion
    Hosting webinars before your conference can be an effective way to build excitement and attract potential attendees.
    Host Teaser Webinars
    Organize webinars featuring some of your main speakers to give a sneak peek of the conference content. Encourage your speakers to promote these webinars through their own channels, expanding your reach to their followers.
    Share Valuable Insights
    Use webinars to share insights that highlight the benefits of attending your conference. Consider recording these sessions and sharing them through your event website or social media channels.
    By providing meaningful content ahead of your event, you engage your audience and build anticipation.
    Plan for Post-Event Follow-Up
